	With this new weather system you can fully customize all aspects of the weather in every region. Within regions.scp you will see the following:

What we are concerned with here is the SNOWCHANCE, RAINCHANCE, WEATHDURATION, and WEATHSTART tags:

SNOWCHANCE 45 55
RAINCHANCE 30 40
WEATHDURATION 300 800
WEATHSTART 700 900

The SNOWCHANCE accepts two numbers, with the first number being smaller then second number. These numbers represent the percentage chance of it snowing within this region. Thus in this region there is a 45% to 55% chance of it snowing.

The RAINCHANCE is exactley the same to SNOWCHANCE, but for rain.

WEATHDURATION is the length of time in real seconds that the weather will last within this region. In our example region it will last from 300 to 800 seconds.

WEATHSTART is how long from the time you started your server or from the last time that there was weather action within that region that it will attempt to start the weather again. This tag also takes 2 variables, and they are both in real seconds aswell. In this example it will attempt to preform a weather action every 700 to 900 seconds since the last time it tried.
