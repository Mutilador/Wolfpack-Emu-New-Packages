                    Wolfpack EMU Updates..by Ripper
                   ----------------------------------

Known bugs: 

If you value the integrity of your worldfiles dont use zero-lag-saves.
To disable them set LOOPSAVE -1 in server.scp
You can still use it, but you have been warned!

If you change scripts while the server is running it might crash.
Freeze the server with the serversleep command while you 
change scripts on the fly.

-----------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed some server freezes  (LB)
2) Fixed busy waiting if no one logged in (activation via nice 4 or nice 5 in wolfpack.ini) (LB)
3) fixed: a bug detected by the msg 'bad char index xxx in file wolfpack.cpp line 2283'
   (a former crash bug with the dispel field spell) (Duke)
4) fixed: a bad create.scp will no longer produce tons of 'Script manager errors' (Duke)
5) added: the Makemenu # to the 'bad create.scp' warning msg. makes it easier to find typos (Duke)
6) fixed: a bug with magic lock/unlock and trap/untrap. (Ripper & Duke)
7) fixed: a very bad bug concerning temporary effects like strength spells/potions. When two effects
   of the same kind affected one player (eg.2 strength spells), the reversing of the second one could
   affect a totally different player!!. Changes for both players (the gain for player 1 and the loss
   for player 2) were permanent ! This bug explains a LOT of 'funny behaviours' that were reported
   and treated as separate bugs. :))) (Duke)
8) fixed: Strength & Agility potions now have a duration of 2 minutes (OSI) (Duke)

9) changed: Network code rewrite part II. (LB) 
   this fixes:
   a) odd login problems (for example players getting someone is already using this account permanently until server restarted)
   b) tons of unreproducable, very bad  & strange bugs when players logged in.
   c) (unnecassairy) lag at login 
   d) insta logout didnt work (insta-logout regions scriptable in regions.scp, charout time in server.scp)  
   e) lots of quirks with networking such as no more than 40 players could connect, (128 now)
      closing of connections out of the blue and more.
   ...

10) fixed: a design bug with the LOG_TRIGGER in server.scp (Duke)
    You can now use normal lumberjacking code, just the creation of
    the logs is redirected to wtrigrs.scp thus eliminating the need
    to put all the axes into envoke.scp :) The old log_trigger was directed
    to triggers.scp with no chance to determine the type of tree. So if somebody
    was using this, he'll have to rewrite his trigger a bit.
11) changed: double durability for weapons & items when used (Duke)
12) fixed: bowfletching didn't work (Duke)
13) fixed: problems with Blacksmithing (Duke)

    members of a guild deleted their chars and the like players from that guild couldn't 
    resign from old guild anymore. those cases get checked and fixed at each  serverstart (LB)
17) fixed: norealmultis were treated as houses (Ripper)
18) tweaked: pet (and npc)-speed (Ripper) 
19) added: serversleep command. serversleep x lets the server sleep for x seconds.
    purpose: if you change scripts on the fly - while the server runs - you might
    experience a server crash we couldn't chase down till 11.9 release.
    If you want to change scripts on the fly safely - use this command and change scripts

----------------------------------------------------------

1) changed: HOUSE_DECAY improvments: Decay status gets shown if you open your house sign. 
Changed the refreshment trigger: Opening the door of your house. 
For all details see housedecay.txt. (LB) 
Remark: you need the new misc.scp if you want to see it.
2) fixed: building houses inside houses, building houses on rocks, trees etc not possible anymore. 
Needs new house.scp. (LB)
3) fixed: sometimes menus didnt work after a certain time. Only a server restart helped. (LB)
4) fixed: dragon ships not working. Needs new house.scp (Ripper)
5) fixed: Logging in multiple times with the same account has been possible  
(though the second login froze the client)  (LB)
6) fixed: server crash on certain spawn-locations. (LB)
7) added: dramatic(!!!) server stability enhancement, removal of loads of dead code. (Duke)
8) fixed: exploit with teleport spell (teleporting on top of chars/npcs) (LB)
9) fixed: (parts of the) network code rewritten, should reduce or kill client freezes. (LB) 
10) fixed: ports other than 2593 didnt work. (LB)
11) fixed: the player lists in the server status html generation was bugged. (LB)
12) added: stabling (for details see stabling.txt) (LB)

if set to 0 items &  npcs spawned with spawn-script (only!) wont be saved. (LB)
16) added: playerlist command. Like wholist, but only shows players online (Ripper)

-----------------------------------------------------------
                        Wolfpack11.7
----------------------------------------------------------

1) fixed: Cooking will no longer leave you with a pile of '0 raw ribs' (Duke)
2) fixed: a potential crash bug with MAXTRACKINGTARGETS >20 (Duke)
3) fixed: two bugs that were detected by the '2179 bad index' msg (Duke)
4) fixed: a bug where a bad wolfpack.ini could destroy the server.scp (Duke)
5) added: the delay for healing with bandages(on top of objectdelay) is now
  scriptable (BANDAGEDELAY in server.scp) (Duke)
6) added: the use of bandages while in combat is now scriptable
  (BANDAGEINCOMBAT in server.scp) (Duke)
7) added: the time until a 'disconnect due to inactivity' occurs is now
  scriptable through the INACTIVITYTIMEOUT keyword in server.scp (Duke)
  Note: only for LAN-environments and debugging. shard-owners should continue
  to use the 300 secs default !)
8) fixed: bad items with an invalid Item-Id crashed the client. 
   Now they get deleted on server startup (LB)
9) fixed: no return after EOF in some scripts -> server freeze. Fixed.
   Now theres no need anymore for the additional return. (LB) 
10) fixed: Spawning items whose item-numbers dont exist in the scripts crashed the server. (LB)
11) fixed: the NOTRAIN keyword now works. NPCs with it won't teach. (Duke)
    Note: a lot of shopkeepers *DO* have this keyword in npcs.scp, and thus in your wsc-files.
    They will stop teaching you ! The ugly side of bugfixing *g*. So you will have
    to edit your scripts and/or wsc-files.
12) fixed: Spellbooks will no longer take damage in combat (Duke)
13) fixed: you can no longer use a lot of funny items (eg. axles,..) as a loom (Duke)

19) fixed: garbage collection rewritten. (LB)
20) fixed: SPAWN.scp not working. Now it works again. The code was so terribly strange/buggy
that I've completely rewritten it. As a side effect - unfortunatly - 
old - pre 11.7 spawn.scp spawns cant be deleted anymore via 'spawnkill.  
If you need to do kill those old spawns do that via wp 11.6
New ones can be deleted via spawnkill command of course.
Also fixed a few flaws in the region-spawn commands  (LB)
21) changed: tweaked some internal data structures for hopefully more performance. (LB)
22) changed: Snooping doesnt flag you criminal anymore (Ripper)
23) fixed: some memory leaks (Duke)
24) fixed: ancient bug in reading accounts.adm. (LB)
The account number given was ignored, instead of it an internal counnter was used.
Example:

section account 3
{
...
}
section account 5
{
..
}

EOF

with pre 11.7 versions this was read as account 0 and 1, not 3 and 5.
Thx to Just Michael pointing that out.
Remark: If you change the account number of *exisitng* chars, you have to change
the accounts value in wpchars of that char manually.
Taken out autocreation and guest accounts due to extreme bugs with it.
Unless there are massive requests for it, it wont be re-activated and fixed.

-----------------------------------------------------------
                        Wolfpack11.6
----------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed: a bad server crash with certain malformed scripts. (LB)

----------------------------------------------------------

1) Fixed: a (major) server crash @ NPC-"AI"-Code (LB)
2) Fixed: a (major) server crash @ NPC-attack-code (LB)
3) Fixed: several other server crashes (LB)
4) started a big code rewrite/restructuring project. (LB & DUKE)
This mass changes will take a long time. At least one month if not more (2?).
If finshed WP should get super-stable and it's readability/maintainability should be increased.
Anyway, we spend weeks to plan how to do that as smooth as possible.
But at least 20.000 Line of code have to be rewritten, so some hoppalas are inevitable.
To fight this, we will do frequent releases! (min: 1 week, max, 2 weeks) till this 
project is finshed.
The more feedback we get, the better it gets.   
If you think of it as multi-step-project, since 11.5 we are in the middle-of step 1.
5) added/started: error_logging to file. (related to 4)
Its very important for us and that you read error_logging.txt (LB)
6) Removed multithreading stuff for now. 
Reason: it had no synch at all. 
This caused severe world file corruption problems. 
(In addition to the problem mentioned under known bugs)
Needs full redesign before being re-enabled.
But please neither delete the rem'ed out threading-code nor reomve the CThread.cpp file.
The same applies to the Weathersystem.
Remark: already done in 11.4, just forgot to mention it (LB)

-----------------------------------------------------------
                        Wolfpack11.4
-----------------------------------------------------------

1) Added: New fishing so when you catch a fish it checks around player to see if other fish are on
the ground and if there is it will stack the fish up to a certain amount and then it wont stack anymore

2) Added: New mining fixes so if you set MINECHECK 1 in server.scp you can only mine mountains

Note1: Memory requirement per Npc is around 1.7kb
Note2: For 100k items thats around -50MB's !
9) Added: DNS-resolution for server address in wolfpack.ini. (LB)
This means you can use an IP adress *or* a "DNS-name" for your server.
example: (new)
Wolfpack test shard
kiste.itc.or.at
2593
###
same example: (old)
Wolfpack test shard
195.202.129.122
2593
###
Note1: both versions work. the old one is still possible.
Note2: localhost equals 127.0.0.1

10) Fixed: the pickpocket dip`s now gain stealing instead of lockpicking.you need
to go into the server.scp and make sure ROGUE 1 is set for stealing to work.then just
use stealing and target a pickpocket dummy and it will raise stealing to 30. (Ripper)
11) Fixed: a problem with smelt items where you could smelt items made with carpentry.(Ripper)
12) Added: You can now d-click the raw fish steaks,raw bird,raw lamb,raw ribs and
raw checken legs and then target fire to cook them, also if you succeed it will cook them all.

17) Fixed: you can now pick cotton without crashing the server (Duke)

18) Added bounty system (see BOUNTY.TXT for details) (dupois@home.com)
19) Updated MSGBOARD.SCP with entries for bounty quest as well as adding a %g
    option to be used as a replaceable parameter for the bounty amount.(Dupois)
20) Removed InitKbThread() call in main() (caused server crash and world file
    corruption when # was pressed at console)  Might also be responsible for script crash.
    Definetly a multithreading issue as I tested it both ways and with InitKbThread() in
    the server would crash and corrupt the world file on a random basis.(Dupois)
21) Added a new wolfpack icon to the distribution for review.(Dupois)

to smelt colored items. then doubleclick a forge and then target the player made item
and it will delete the item and give you half the ingots it took to make the item. (Ripper)
