<page no="1"> In a time before
time, the Gods that
be assembled a group
of artisans, crafts
men and lore masters
(for, yes, even in
those days, art
existed)to create the</page>
<page no="2">world of Sosaria. To
this group, the gods
gave a tiny world,
Rytabul, in which to
test their works, to
see if they were of
the quality desired
for the true world in</page>
<page no="3">which they would be
placed.  And though
the gods were tight
fisted with their
gold, this small crew
worked hard and long,
and were happy in
their tasks.</page>
<page no="4"> A small corner of
Rytabul had been
claimed by the
artisan Selrahc the
Slow. Though he was
Not the fastest of
The assembled
workers, the gods</page>
<page no="5">smiled upon his work,
even presenting him
with a mystic
talisman proclaiming
his work the best
among the newer
artisans.And so
Selrahc went about</page>
<page no="6">his business,
creating hundreds
of designs which
would one day add
color and variety
to Sosaria. One day a
stranger appeared to
Selrahc.  His chest</page>
<page no="7">was bare and he wore
trousers of the
brightest green, and
whereever he went,
plants grew in his
footsteps. This
caused Selrahc no end
of trouble, the</page>
<page no="8">stranger always
looking over his
shoulder, and the
plants sprouting in
places Selrahc
required to ply his
art. And so Selrahc
approached the</page>
<page no="9">stranger and bade
him speak.  But this
man in green
remained silent.
Selrahc pleaded with
the stranger to give
his name, and would
he please leave</page>
<page no="10">Selrahc to his work.
But this mysterious
stranger remained
mute.
 This angered
Selrahc mightily. Who
was this silent man,
interfering with</page>
<page no="11">tasks the gods
themselves had
entrusted to Selrahc?
In an attempt to
embarrass this
interloper, Selrahc
stole his green
trousers, leaving him</page>
<page no="12">naked and open to
comments about his
very manhood, and
still the stranger
would not speak,
would not leave this
tiny corner of
Rytabul.</page>
<page no="13">Vexed to his very
limits, Selrahc took
his war axe and
smote the silent one
mightily, again and
again, until the
silent stranger ran
away, having never</page>
<page no="14">said a word, and
never showed himself
in Rytabul again.
 Thus endeth the
tale of the bold
stranger.</page>
