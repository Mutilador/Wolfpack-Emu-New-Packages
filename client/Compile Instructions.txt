
1. Please download Qt 4.4

1.1. Download from Trolltech
http://www.trolltech.com
This is appropiate if you are not on the Windows platform or if you are using MinGW on windows.

1.2. Download precompiled for Microsoft Visual Studio
If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio (Or the Intel compiler) and find compiling Qt
yourself tiresome, you can download a precompiled version of Qt 4.4 for Visual Studio here:

2. Download Python 2.5 from http://www.python.org (Not neccessary if your system already
includes the Python 2.5 libraries). If you want to compile the client in debug mode, you 
will need to build Python yourself. Please follow their build instructions for this. If you
only want to build the release version, the Python 2.5 Windows installer includes a precompiled
python25.lib for you.

4. Compile the client

4.1 Using Visual Studio
Run "qmake -tp vc" in the client directory and open the resulting uoclient.vcproj file with your IDE.

4.2 Using QMake
Run "qmake" in the client directory and run either "nmake" to build everything or any other appropiate
build command for your platform (i.e. "make" on Linux).
