Using Microsoft Visual Sutdio .NET
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Please download QT 4.0.1 from http://www.trolltech.com/download/qt/windows.html
and install it. Then download the patch from http://andy.jgknet.de/misc/msvc-bcc32-Qt-4.0.1patch.zip
and apply it to your QT installation and compile. (Both Debug and Release binaries). Once you are done with that,
make sure QTDIR is set to your QT directory and QMAKESPEC is set to win32-msvc.net (Both are environmental
variables). If you change those variables, you have to restart your IDE.

2. You need OpenAL to compile the client (with sound). Get that at http://www.openal.org and put 
the libs/ and include/ directory into your library and header search path.

3. Download the Python 2.4.1 source package from http://www.python.org and compile it with Visual Studio.
(Open PCBuil/python.sln and compile the entire solution in both debug and release mode. Ignore errors for
certain projects since only pythoncore is important). Once you're done, make sure that Include/ and Pc/
are included in your header search path and that PCBuild/ is included in your library search path.

4. Open the UoClient.sln with the IDE and press compile. It should work
out of the box.
