Emboss Text is given a color for the border (Should be default implemented) which is a 32-bit color value.
The implementation then draws the normal border but does the following: 

If left or below the current border pixel is a non-transparent pixel from the text, 
draw the darkest color.
If above or right of the current border pixel is a non-transparent pixel from the text,
draw the brightest color.
If both of the above conditions are met, draw the medium color.

To the drawing function the color for the brightest color is given.
The darkest color is composed of the color components of the brightest color
divided by two.
The medium color is the average of the color components of the brightest and darkest color.
